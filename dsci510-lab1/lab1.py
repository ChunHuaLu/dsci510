# ### Computer hardware architecture
# - Central Processing Unit (CPU)
# - Main Memory
#     - store information that the CPU needs and is nearly as fast as CPU
# - Secondary Memory
#     - slower than main memory, can store memory when there is no power to the computer
# - Input & Output Devices
#     - screen, keyboard, mouse...

# ### Interpreter & compiler
# Interpreter
# - interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.
# Compiler
# - needs to be handed the entire program in a file, and translate high-level source code to machine language and then the compiler puts the resulting machine language into a file for later execution

# ### Values & types

# In[2]:


print(4)
print(type("Hello World"))
print(type(17))
print(type(3.2))
print(type("17"))
print(type("3.2"))


# ### Operations and Operands

# In[3]:


minute = 59
print("modulus 59 / 60")
print(minute/60)
print("modulus 59 // 60")
print(minute//60)
print("remainder")
print("modulus 59 % 5")
print(minute%5)
print("exponential 59*59*59")
print(minute**3)


# ### string operation

# In[4]:


first = "100"
second = "200"
print(first+second)
print(first*3)
